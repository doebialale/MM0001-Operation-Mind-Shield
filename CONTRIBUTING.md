# Contributing to Operation Mind Shield

First of all, thank you for taking part of the SuperDataScience Monthly Mission: Operation Mind Shield. Every month, we try to give the community open challenges to practice their skills in Data Science / Machine Learning / AI to help them build a portfolio of projects and get hands-on experience.

This document will guide you through the process of contributing. Please take a moment to read it before submitting your contributions.

## How Can I Contribute?

### **What is the format for submission?**

In the submissions folder of this repo, you will find an example of the folder and file naming structure that we follow. You will find a jupyter notebook in submissions > shaheer-airaj > shaheer_operation_mind_shield.ipynb which contains some markdown information. You can copy this notebook into a folder with your own name, fill out the information in the markdown and continue on building your submission.

The preference for submission is to have one notebook with all your work containing clear comments and markdown.

### **Where do I place my submissions?**

In this repository, you will find a submissions folder. Within this folder, create another folder with your full name (as seen on SDS) and place all your submissions in this folder to make sure the repo is clean and easy to navigate.

Eg.

Submissions > shaheer-airaj > shaheer_operation_mind_shield.ipynb

Please make sure that all your submissions follow the same folder and file naming structure or your submissions may not be considered.

3. **Make Your Changes**:  
   Develop your feature, bug fix, or documentation update. Make sure your code is well-documented, readable, and adheres to the project’s coding standards.

4. **Test Your Changes**:

5. **Commit Your Changes**:  
   Write a clear commit message describing what you’ve done:
