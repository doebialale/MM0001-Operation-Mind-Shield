# üß† Operation Mind Shield: Decoding Alzheimer's

Welcome to **Operation Mind Shield**, data science challenge initiated by SuperDataScience focused on predicting Alzheimer's Disease based on patient data. This mission is designed for data scientists of all skill levels, with three different **Assignments** tailored to your expertise. Dive into the dataset, tackle the assignment that best matches your skills, and contribute to this collaborative project.

## üõ† How to Contribute

Please read our CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines on how to contribute.

## üìú Mission Brief

In this mission, you will work with a dataset on Alzheimer's Disease patients. The goal is to build predictive models to determine the likelihood of a patient having Alzheimer's based on various features.

You'll progress through three phases depending on the assignment level you choose:
- **Data Cleaning & Analysis**
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Selection**
- **Model Selection & Fine-Tuning**

## üéØ Mission Objectives

- **Predict** whether a patient has Alzheimer's based on the available features.
- **Clean and preprocess** the data to improve the performance of your models.
- **Train models** that best suit your experience level, from simple to highly advanced.
- **Evaluate** your model's performance using appropriate validation techniques.
- **(Advanced Level Only)** Deploy your model using a **Streamlit App**.

## üèÜ Assignments

### 1. **Assignment 1: The Initiate** (Beginner Level)
- Perform **basic data cleaning**.
- Build a **simple linear model** (e.g., Logistic Regression).
- Evaluate your model with a **simple test set**.

### 2. **Assignment 2: The Specialist** (Intermediate Level)
- Conduct **elaborate data cleaning** with **1 feature selection step**.
- Train more advanced models like **Gradient Boosting**.
- Use **k-fold cross-validation** for evaluation.
- Perform basic **hyperparameter tuning**.

### 3. **Assignment 3: The Operative** (Advanced Level)
- Engage in **advanced data preprocessing** (looping feature selection and feature extraction using **PCA/LDA**).
- Build **ensemble models** using powerful frameworks (e.g., **SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning**).
- Perform extensive **hyperparameter tuning**.
- Evaluate using **k-fold cross-validation**.
- Deploy your model through a **Streamlit App**.
